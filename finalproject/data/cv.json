He built a multimillion-dollar dental practice in Centennial, Colorado, featuring an in-house implant milling lab and clinical training center. After selling his practice to Heartland Dental, he became the lead doctor and mentor for Professional Dental, overseeing the development and clinical quality of 22 practices. Dr. Lind's academic background is expansive and interdisciplinary. In addition to his dental credentials and advanced training in implantology, prosthodontics, sedation, and esthetics, he holds a Master of Business Administration (MBA) in Healthcare Administration, a Master’s in Public Health (MPH), and a Master's degree in Biblical Studies. He is also currently completing a Ph.D. in Psychology, with a focus on human behavior, cognition, and cultural context. He earned certification in Biblical Hebrew and Hebraic Studies from Hebrew University in Jerusalem and completed 29 courses in depth psychology through the Jungian Institute and Saybrook University. He also holds a Certificate in Family History and Genealogy from BYU-Idaho. Now based in Utah, Dr. Lind continues to lecture globally and consult with dental manufacturers, researchers, and educators.
